            <h5>Does Store Locator support for multi-stores?</h5>
			<p>Yes, it allows you to apply for multiple stores as you need.</p>

			<h5>How many ways are there to find the nearest stores?</h5>
			<p>
			There are 3 ways to help customers find the stores conveniently:<br>
			<ul>
				<li>Search by distance (within the specified radius from the current location).</li>
				<li>Search by area (within a specific state/ province, country, city, zip code) </li>
				<li>Filter by tags (product types, product brands,...)</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
			<p>For the radius, you can allow using miles or kilometers within the searching from Magento Admin. Moreover, you can set for each store with link to website, contact information, and an icon to be used on the map instead of the traditional location marker.</p>

			<h5>Is there any conflict with other extension after I install Store Locator module?</h5>
			<p>Almost No, it is developed comfortably and compatible well with other extensions. If you have any issue, feel free to contact us.</p>
